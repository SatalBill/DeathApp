##  Funerals 101

A funeral is one of many ways to honor the dead. Rites and customs vary across cultures, but funerals are typically religious ceremonies in which the body is present. Because of this, funerals tend to happen fairly quickly after someone dies — usually within a week or, in some cases, as soon as 24 hours after death.

There is no right or wrong way to have a funeral — and there’s no law that says you have to have one. Increasingly, people are opting for ceremonies that are less expensive, eco-friendly, and more personalized than traditional funerals. The image we have from the movies — an embalmed body and a satin-lined casket — is a relatively recent practice with roots in consumerism, not religion.

Whatever route you choose, there are three phases to take into account:
1.  Preparing the body.
2.  Holding the ceremony.
3.  “Dispatching” the body or remains.

Below, we break down each phase, define common terms, and outline the options.

### 1. Preparing the Body
**As Is**: The corpse isn’t embalmed or cremated. It is cleaned, washed, dressed, and kept cold — with dry ice, through refrigeration, or by keeping indoor temperatures cool.

* *Wait, is this legal?* Yes. Preparing the body at home was standard practice for years, and it is still legal to do so. The amount of time the body can stay there — and the steps you must take to do so — varies from state to state. 
* *Trends*: This method is slowly becoming more common as the positive death movement and greener methods of interment (or burial) gain popularity.

**Cremation**: The disposal of an embalmed corpse by burning it to ashes, typically after an open-casket funeral ceremony. The ashes — or cremains — are returned to the family. These can be kept, scattered, buried in a graveyard, put into a columbarium — a room or building with niches to store funeral urns — or turned into a diamond (among other things).

* *Average costs*
    * Through a funeral home: $1,600 and $3,000
    * Through a crematory: $1,000 and $2,200
 * *Alternative containers*
	 * Laws vary state by state, but most require that the dead be burned in a container. Simple (and less-expensive) cardboard boxes are sometimes referred to as "alternative containers." 
	 * The only requirements are that the container must be combustible, nontoxic, and sturdy enough to hold the weight of the body.

**Direct Cremation**: Cremation without embalming. The corpse goes from the place of death to a crematory. Ashes are returned to the family.
* *Good to know*: You can contact a crematory directly — you don’t need to use a funeral home
* *Average costs*:
	* $1,000 and $2,200

**Embalming**: A corpse is drained of bodily fluids and filled with formaldehyde. This slows the natural process of decay, allowing the body to be displayed in an open casket before burial. Embalming is not a legal requirement. For years, embalming was the standard practice — but the rise of the positive death movement and a trend toward greener methods of interment (or burial) has shifted the funeral industry.
* *Average costs*:
	* $500-$700

### 2. Holding the Ceremony
**A Viewing, Visitation or Wake**: An opportunity for mourners to be with the body and pay their respects to the family. Religious and cultural customs differ, but it’s typically an unstructured event held within a few days of death — and before the funeral. Funeral homes hold these events in visitation rooms, or families can host them at home.

**Funeral Service**: A formal service, with an officiant and a clear structure, that’s usually held at a place of worship within a week of death. The body, in a casket, is typically present.

**Memorial Service**: A funeral service’s less formal cousin — or, a funeral service without the body present.

**Graveside service**: This is a short, scripted service at the graveyard just before remains are interred. A graveside service is smaller and more intimate than a funeral, often attended only by family and closest friends. Some people have a graveside service after a funeral service, with mourners following the body in a funeral procession to the cemetery. Some have a graveside service instead of a funeral service.

### 3. **Dispatching the Body or Remains**
**Traditional burial**: The remains go in the ground, either as an embalmed body in a casket that’s placed in a subterranean burial vault, or as an urn of ashes in an urn vault. A burial vault is a container made of concrete, steel or wood that encases the casket. It keeps the grave from collapsing and prevents toxic embalming fluids from seeping into the ground. You can also opt for a grave liner that covers the top and sides of a casket but leaves it in contact with ground.

**Immediate burial**: Also called a green burial, an un-embalmed body is put directly into the ground, usually with a graveside service. It may be in a casket, or — if you’re opting for a green burial — wrapped in a shroud or placed in a biodegradable container of some sort. Unlike traditional burials that fight decomposition, immediate burials accept the forces of nature and allow the body to decompose more quickly.

**Scattering of ashes**: The cremains are scattered in a place that was special to the deceased: a beach they loved, a trail they liked to hike, a forest where they played as a child.

**Creative options**: There are a slew of companies offering novel ways to dispose of ashes. You can have your cremains turned into food for a tree seedling, added to a manmade reef, or incorporated into fireworks and shot into the sky. Because urns are so, so boring.

const sleep = `## A Self-Care Expert Shares Her Tips for a Good Night’s Sleep

Let’s talk sleep. How are you sleeping? Is your sleep feeling interrupted? Or is the quality of your sleep not as deep as usual? Is all you want to do sleep? Or are you too wired to fully make it through a full night? All of this is totally common in times of great change and grief and sadness. Here we can talk a bit about the effect grief has on sleep and ways to improve your rest. Having a healthy sleep cycle and sleep hygiene is so important to our overall health and wellness but dealing with a death most likely has negatively impacted your sleep and disrupted your sleep patterns, which then leads you to be more tired than usual which can then make everything that you are feeling, feel even worse. By talking about it and coming up with small changes and tools, you can hopefully stop the cycle before it starts as this is a time your body needs to heal and rest is so important for this deep healing. Make sure to not forget to do the basics when it comes to sleep hygiene: limit screen time before bed, keep your bedroom a bit cooler and if possible- keep the tv and technology out of the room, get an alarm clock so that you can turn your phone off, be mindful of caffeine and alcohol intake as they both negatively affect your quality of sleep.

### **The Healing Power Of Sleep**
Sleep helps the body to release hormones that can slow breathing, and relax other muscles in the body. This process can reduce inflammation and assist with healing. 
A good night's sleep can improve your mood, help you stay alert and boost your memory. Now data shows that getting enough sleep might also help your cuts to heal more promptly. In fact, they found that sleep was more important than good nutrition in speeding wound healing. So take these healing sleep findings a step further and realize what a priority it is, as you begin to heal your mind, body, and spirit after dealing with a death.

### **Rituals and Lifestyle Practices for Sleep**
Avoid drinking water/beverages an hour and a half before bed (to eliminate having to go to the bathroom and waking up). If you are drinking herbal teas to help with sleep consider having them after dinner time and not right before bed. Tinctures (like a sleep blend or valerian) dropped in a bit of water are a better way to use herbs, if you have an issue with waking up to go to the bathroom at night.

Eat a spoonful of almond or peanut butter or coconut oil before bed, in case what is waking you up is a blood sugar drop. This seems like a simple tip but depending on how your metabolism and hormones and eating schedule are- this could really help.

Look at your caffeine intake and consider gradually lessening the amount you are drinking, and to avoid withdrawal symptoms (irritability, fatigue) don’t quit all at once. Also look at when you are drinking caffeine and try to have the last cup no later than 12pm. If you are having real issues with sleeping, it can be really helpful to give yourself a few months off from drinking coffee and see how you feel. And in case you want to try alternatives, here is a list of beverages from most to least amounts of caffeine: Coffee,black tea, green tea, herbal tea.

Epsom salt bath with low lighting or candlelight for 5-20 min. Or soak your feet if that is all you can do. The magnesium in the salts is very relaxing to the body and gets you in the mood to sleep.

Self massage with warm oil, also called Abhyanga (great after a bath). This is where you take warm coconut or sesame oil and massage your entire body and scalp. It is best to sit on an old towel so you don’t have to worry about oil getting everywhere. Massage every part of your body, from your feet up to the crown of your head. Keeping in mind that there are  7,000 nerve endings on each foot, so giving both a massage helps loosen the entire body. Also massaging the scalp is where the nerves start and has a comparable effect.

Daily mediation is a great way to help with stress which can support deeper and better sleep. Start with even just 2 minutes a day and work up to 15 or 20 min. Apps like headspace or Calm or Insight Timer are some of my favorites. Just sit comfortably and breath in and out, paying attention to your breath.

Befriend the lavender plant. Lavender (latin name, Lavandula Officinalis).
A few drops of essential oil of lavender added to a foot soak or a regular bath can have a nice, calming effect. Or put a few drops of the essential oil on a tissue and tuck it into your pillowcase for some aromatherapy as you fall asleep, to help get you in the mood for sleep and also help with insomnia.

Herbs for sleep. Plants like valerian, hops, passionflower, skullcap, cannabis (CBD) are all helpful for sleep. You can try drinking an herbal tea blend with some of these plants in a sleep blend before or in a tincture (an herbal medicine made from steeping herbs in alcohol). Tinctures may be better for sleep issues, because with tea, drinking a liquid before bed and getting up to go to the bathroom is an unnecessary disruption to your sleep.

Allow sleep and rest into your life. I want to offer the idea of allowing yourself to imagine getting 8-10 hours of sleep tonight. You may have to do some personal work around the blocks and stories you are telling yourself about how much sleep you normally get or can get. Even if it seems impossible to imagine. Allow yourself to sit with the idea about getting more sleep and your right to it. It is a time where we heal, bring our bodies back to balance, and replenish our nervous systems. And with the concept of sleep, please consider also allowing more rest into your life. The work of Tricia Hersey and her Nap Ministry are very inspiring when it comes to learning how to accept more rest into our lives. This can look like a nap, closing your eyes for 10 minutes in your parked car, a swing in a hammock, reading a book you love, drinking your tea outside and listening to the birds. Doing things that are without technology and your to do list will replenish you deeply and believe me, you deserve more rest in your life. It can be great to get an eye pillow filled with plants like lavender, rose, and chamomile to lay over your eyes when you nap, to help relieve the pressure on your eyes if you have been crying or looking at screens a lot, and help a force rest.`

const tips_for_personalized_memorials = `## Tips for Personalizing a Funeral, Memorial, or Celebration of Life
End-of-life ceremonies give individuals and communities a chance to honor and celebrate the dead. For many, they’re an integral part of grieving and healing. 

While many cultural and religious ceremonies ascribe to traditional customs, there are as many ways to celebrate the dead as there are deaths. The first step to personalizing any end-of-life ceremony is to identify the passions, interests, and hobbies of the person you’re honoring. From the choice of music at a funeral to the thematic decorations at a raucous party, there are countless ways to bring the spirit and energy of the dead into a service or celebration. 

**Plant a tree or a garden.** Mark a death with new life. Find a place that held meaning for the deceased and choose a plant or plants they loved — the flowers from their wedding or the type of tree that surrounded their favorite mountain getaway. 

**Choose meaningful flowers.** Flowers and floral arrangements the deceased would have loved  — incorporate colors and varieties that held meaning for them. 

Flowers offer a lot of flexibility for all ceremony types — wear them as boutineers or corsages, placed on reception tables, or carry them to lay on the casket before burial. If you chose to hold a ceremony at a meaningful location by the sea or lake, release petals across the water. 

**Make music.** Music conveys emotion, sparks memories, and can relieve tension and stress as a way to promote healing. Choose songs that hold meaning for the deceased or capture the intended mood of the ceremony. Hire a live band, set up a karaoke station, or ask friends and family to play the deceased’s favorites songs. 

**Share memories.** Create a playlist of favorite songs that your friend or family loved and share it with your event attendees to take home. Read aloud a favorite poem or passage from a beloved book or play and ask different people in their community to add their voice. Build an arts and crafts table —  give guests colored pencils, pens and paper to draw or recount their favorite memories and pin them up for everyone to see.

**Give back.** Bring friends and family together for a run, walk, or bike ride that supports a cause the deceased held dear. Or, suggest organizations or communities the deceased was involved with that friends and family can support in their name. These can be anything from a local theater group or animal shelter to a medical research foundation or school. 

**Get spiffy.** Show support for their favorite sports team, club, or college sorority by wearing a jersey, hat, tie, or scarf with their special colors. If they had a favorite clothing item that they wore and was their “signature look,” ask attendees to wear something like it to the funeral - maybe a flat cap, a pair of fun socks, or funky sunglasses. Funerals tend toward more somber ceremonies than celebrations of life — it’s ok to ask guests to pay tribute to the deceased by adding in a little color to their wardrobe if it feels appropriate.

### Collect & Share Memories
**Photos.** Ask close friends and family to collect and share photos from the deceased’s life - pictures of the everyday life and the big life events - everything that highlights the breadth of life they lived. If you collect images before your end of life event, create a video, slideshow, or big poster of special memories to share with everyone during the ceremony. Alternatively, ask attendees to bring pictures with them to the service or celebration and ask people to add to the photo collage.  Scanned the shared photos and a send to attendees later on.

**Quotes & Written Memories.** Ask attendees to write reflections on small pieces of paper and add them to a box of memories. If friends and family have brought drawings, pictures, or quotes that hold special meaning, invite them to share those as well and create a small table or shrine to honor their memory. If loved ones can’t attend an in person event, create a memorial website and share it with the deceased’s larger social circle. If you plan to have a guest book, consider swapping it out for an image of the deceased with a wide frame and invite attendees to write little messages directly on the frame. 

**Give Away Mementos.** A great way to slowly sort through the deceased belongings while ensuring their treasured things are going to friends and family is to bring books, trinkets, and items to the end of life ceremony. Invite attendees to take a book to remember them by and think of them when they read it.

### Make New Memories
**Visit Meaningful Places.** If the deceased was cremated, consider spreading their ashes in a place that was meaningful to them in their lifetime. Create a ritual of visiting this place over the years with friends and family to honor the experience. Commemorate a bench in a favorite park — a place they used to sit and think or talk. Host an annual reception or picnic in that park each year, go on their favorite hike, or visit a place that reminds you of them. 

**Create a New Tradition.** Celebrations of Life do not have to take place immediately after a death nor do they have to be a singular event. Consider creating a new tradition that honors them with a candle lighting service, annual dinner party with their favorite foods, or a tea party in the garden. If being together isn’t possible, celebrate their birthday with a zoom hangout and share memories to keep their memory alive. 

### Planning in a Pandemic 
COVID-19 has forced many mourners to postpone ceremonial events for health and safety reasons. While holding traditional funerals and memorial events haven’t always been to plan,  and may not be for some time, there are lots of ways to honor your loved ones in your future - and they don’t fit any timeline or prescribed ceremony. Take advantage of the ability to create a celebration that will afford you and your loved ones the greatest flexibility and accommodation in honoring your loved one — and know there is not one right way to do so.

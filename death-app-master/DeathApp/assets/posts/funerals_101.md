##  Funerals 101

A funeral is one of many ways to honor the dead. Rites and customs vary across cultures, but funerals are typically religious ceremonies in which the body is present. Because of this, funerals tend to happen fairly quickly after someone dies — usually within a week or, in some cases, as soon as 24 hours after death.

There is no right or wrong way to have a funeral — and there’s no law that says you have to have one. Increasingly, people are opting for ceremonies that are less expensive, eco-friendly, and more personalized than traditional funerals. The image we have from the movies — an embalmed body and a satin-lined casket — is a relatively recent practice with roots in consumerism, not religion.

Whatever route you choose, there are three phases to take into account:
1.  Preparing the body.
2.  Holding the ceremony.
3.  “Dispatching” the body or remains.

Below, we break down each phase, define common terms, and outline the options.

### 1. Preparing the Body
**As Is**: The corpse isn’t embalmed or cremated. It is cleaned, washed, dressed, and kept cold — with dry ice, through refrigeration, or by keeping indoor temperatures cool.

* *Wait, is this legal?* Yes. Preparing the body at home was standard practice for years, and it is still legal to do so. The amount of time the body can stay there — and the steps you must take to do so — varies from state to state. 
* *Trends*: This method is slowly becoming more common as the positive death movement and greener methods of interment (or burial) gain popularity.

**Cremation**: The disposal of an embalmed corpse by burning it to ashes, typically after an open-casket funeral ceremony. The ashes — or cremains — are returned to the family. These can be kept, scattered, buried in a graveyard, put into a columbarium — a room or building with niches to store funeral urns — or turned into a diamond (among other things).

* *Average costs*
    * Through a funeral home: $1,600 and $3,000
    * Through a crematory: $1,000 and $2,200
 * *Alternative containers*
	 * Laws vary state by state, but most require that the dead be burned in a container. Simple (and less-expensive) cardboard boxes are sometimes referred to as "alternative containers." 
	 * The only requirements are that the container must be combustible, nontoxic, and sturdy enough to hold the weight of the body.

**Direct Cremation**: Cremation without embalming. The corpse goes from the place of death to a crematory. Ashes are returned to the family.
* *Good to know*: You can contact a crematory directly — you don’t need to use a funeral home
* *Average costs*:
	* $1,000 and $2,200

**Embalming**: A corpse is drained of bodily fluids and filled with formaldehyde. This slows the natural process of decay, allowing the body to be displayed in an open casket before burial. Embalming is not a legal requirement. For years, embalming was the standard practice — but the rise of the positive death movement and a trend toward greener methods of interment (or burial) has shifted the funeral industry.

	* $500-$700

### 2. Holding the Ceremony
**A Viewing, Visitation or Wake**: An opportunity for mourners to be with the body and pay their respects to the family. Religious and cultural customs differ, but it’s typically an unstructured event held within a few days of death — and before the funeral. Funeral homes hold these events in visitation rooms, or families can host them at home.

**Funeral Service**: A formal service, with an officiant and a clear structure, that’s usually held at a place of worship within a week of death. The body, in a casket, is typically present.

**Memorial Service**: A funeral service’s less formal cousin — or, a funeral service without the body present.

**Graveside service**: This is a short, scripted service at the graveyard just before remains are interred. A graveside service is smaller and more intimate than a funeral, often attended only by family and closest friends. Some people have a graveside service after a funeral service, with mourners following the body in a funeral procession to the cemetery. Some have a graveside service instead of a funeral service.

### 3. **Dispatching the Body or Remains**
**Traditional burial**: The remains go in the ground, either as an embalmed body in a casket that’s placed in a subterranean burial vault, or as an urn of ashes in an urn vault. A burial vault is a container made of concrete, steel or wood that encases the casket. It keeps the grave from collapsing and prevents toxic embalming fluids from seeping into the ground. You can also opt for a grave liner that covers the top and sides of a casket but leaves it in contact with ground.

**Immediate burial**: Also called a green burial, an un-embalmed body is put directly into the ground, usually with a graveside service. It may be in a casket, or — if you’re opting for a green burial — wrapped in a shroud or placed in a biodegradable container of some sort. Unlike traditional burials that fight decomposition, immediate burials accept the forces of nature and allow the body to decompose more quickly.

**Scattering of ashes**: The cremains are scattered in a place that was special to the deceased: a beach they loved, a trail they liked to hike, a forest where they played as a child.

**Creative options**: There are a slew of companies offering novel ways to dispose of ashes. You can have your cremains turned into food for a tree seedling, added to a manmade reef, or incorporated into fireworks and shot into the sky. Because urns are so, so boring.
